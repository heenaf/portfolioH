        I'm a passionate Computer Science Engineering student currently in my pre-final year. 
        With a deep-rooted enthusiasm for coding ,I'm dedicated to crafting innovative websites and projects
         with real-world applications.
I find joy in exploring new technologies and skills to enhance my expertise. My core focus lies in front-end development, where I specialize in leveraging tools and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and more to bring ideas to life in the digital realm.

Besides building websites, I enjoy reading books and writing poetry in my free time. I love connecting with others who share my interests, which helps me stay up-to-date with the latest in technology.
